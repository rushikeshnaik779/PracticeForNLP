# Stemming
Stemming achieves the root word by cutting the last alphabet letters of a word. These root words are also known as stems. But stem not always become a root word. And the sentence becomes meaningless. Stemming also reduces the accuracy of a model.
There are different types of stemming algorithms. We use only Porterâ€™s algorithm and the Snowball algorithm in this article. These algorithms are most effective than others.


# Lemmatization
Lemmatization method has analyzed the structure of words, the relationship between words and parts of words to accurately identify the root word. Part of speech tagger and vocabulary words helps to return the dictionary form of a word. But this requires a lot of processing time and disk space as compared to Stemming method. The accuracy of the NLP model is comparatively high in this method. The root word is known as a lemma.
